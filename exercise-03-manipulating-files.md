# Manipulating files
Everything in Linux is represented as a file. It does not matter if it's a folder, a hard drive or a speaker. As such manipulating files is a very important skill to have. In this exercise, we will learn how to create, edit, copy, move and delete files and folders.

1. Create a new folder called 'my-folder' within the folder 'first-folder'
2. Within the new folder, create a new file called 'my-file.txt'
3. Copy the file 'important-document.txt' in 'first-folder/inner-folder' to the folder new folder and call it 'my-important-document.txt'
4. Move the file 'my-important-document.txt' to the folder 'first-folder/inner-folder' and give it a new name.
5. Change the content of the file 'my-important-document.txt' to 'This is a my own document' or something similar.
